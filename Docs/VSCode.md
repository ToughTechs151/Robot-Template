## Install extensions

### How to install extensions in VSCode
To install extensions in VSCode, you first click on the extensions side bar (or type Ctrl+Shift+X). ![extension tab icon](img/ext-tab.jpg) It will show you a list of your installed extensions. Use this list to verify that you have the extensions in the following section installed. To search of an extension, simply type its name in the search field at the top of the extensions panel and it will display all the extensions in the extension marketplace that have those words. When you find the one you want, click on it to bring up an editor window with its description page. To install it, click on the "Install" button, either on the description page, or the one next to its name in the extensions list. After the extension is install, the install button on the list will change to settings gear icon, and the button on description will change to "Uninstall". You can use this "Uninstall" button to uninstall the extension if you no longer want it.

In a later section in this document we will deal with how to set these extensions up, but for now, just install them.
